# Redmine to Zendesk Issue Bridge

This is a Redmine plugin that uses the Zendesk API to query a particular custom field (e.g. Redmine Issue ID) to pull in a list of associated tickets to the issue view. It has been tested with Redmine 2.6.x.

## Use Case

- You use Zendesk to manage your customer support requests
- You use Redmine to manage your development team's bug fixes
- When you create a Redmine issue to address a customer ticket, you cross-reference it in the Zendesk ticket via a custom field
- You need to see a list of related tickets when viewing a Redmine issue

## Installation

Installs the same as any Redmine 2.x plugin. Please [read this guide](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins#Installing-a-plugin) for basic tips.

1. Unzip or clone into to your `./plugins` folder (e.g. `/path/to/redmine/plugins/redmine_zendesk_issue_bridge`)
2. Run `bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production` from your Redmine root directory to pick up the necessary Gems
3. Restart your Redmine instance
4. Go to `Administration` > `Plugins` to verify that the plugin is shown
5. Click `Configure`
